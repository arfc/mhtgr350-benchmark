Geometry files:
---------------
* assembly.geo:
	- each cooling channel is a different material

* assembly-gap.geo
	- models the bypass
	- each cooling channel and the bypass gap are different materials

* assembly-gap-mesh.geo
	- it is equal to the previous geometry, but the film and helium gap are thicker so it is possible to see them

Input files:
------------
* input.i:
	- no bypass gap
	- assembly.msh: 80376 dof, 128 cores = 20 sec

* input-g:
	- bypass gap
	- assembly-gap.msh

The gap is 3 mm between fuel assemblies.
This model includes only half gap (1.5 mm).

* input-g-mesh.i:
	- it is just here to make the mesh figure
