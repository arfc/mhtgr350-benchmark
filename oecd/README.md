* oecd-exI-1b:
	- Fuel compact
	- Explicit and random
	- HFP
	- oecd material composition (I had to calculate it)

* oecd-exI-1b2:
	- Fuel compact
	- Explicit and random
	- HFP
	- uses same material compositon as CRP

* oecd-exI-1b3:
	- Fuel compact
	- Explicit and random
	- HFP
	- oecd material composition from Benchmark Phase III

* oecd-exI-2a:
	- H = 4.928
	- Fuel element
	- Explicit and random
	- HFP
	- oecd material composition from Benchmark Phase III

* oecd-standard-column
	- fuel column
	- Explicit and random
	- HFP
	- oecd material composition from Benchmark Phase III

* oecd-fullcore
	- fuel column
	- Explicit and random
	- HFP
	- oecd material composition from Benchmark Phase III
